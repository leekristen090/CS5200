# CS5200 Final Project Deliverable
Provide a README section for creating and running the project. We need complete specifications 
for building your project on our computer. Specify all libraries, software, etc. needed to run 
the application. Specify expected installation directories. If you use a specific technology for 
the project, the technology’s download page must be listed.

## DB Application 
You must have connectivity from your front end to your database in order to receive any points 
for this task. The host languages supported are the latest versions are Java, Python, 
javascript and R. Approval of any other language must be given in feedback from the 
project proposal.

Please be sure to include all  developed client code, i.e. all CRUD 
operations (create, read, update, delete). 

**The application, at a minimum needs to allow a user to:**

- [x] Create new tuples in the database
  * More points allotted for different types of entities created                                      
- [x] Read data from the database 
  * More points allotted for different tables read                                                                                  
- [ ] Update tuples in the database
  * More points allotted for more tables providing the update operation                                       
- [ ] Delete data tuples from the database
  * More points allotted for different tables supported for the delete operations  

**The project will be evaluated by the following criteria:**

* Functionality provided by the project is a complete solution for the chosen data domain and 
the chosen use of the application
* Modularization of code, such as use of functions in the front end code as well as use of SQL 
user defined procedures, functions, triggers, and events          
* Error handling system (testing of arguments, user input, ability to gracefully handle errors 
from the DBMS using techniques such as catch/try mechanism)              
* Submitted project is complete -> No missing files
* Easy to use front end application
  * Prompts are easy to interpret, good feedback on input

## Final report requirements **(to be deleted before submission)**
Please use your project proposal report as a starting point to create your project’s final report. 
Provide a single document that contains the following sections:
- [ ] README 
  * Provide a README section for creating and running the project. We need complete specifications 
    for building your project on our computer. Specify all libraries, software, etc. needed to run
    the application. Specify expected installation directories. If you use a specific
    technology for the project, the technology’s download page must be listed.
- [ ] Provide the Technical Specifications for the project 
  * This entails the software used to build the project such as the host language and 
  any other frameworks used
- [ ] Provide the current conceptual design as a UML diagram for the project
- [ ] Provide a logical design for the submitted database schema 
  * (Feel free to Reverse Engineer your final schema in the MySQL workbench)
- [ ] Provide the final user flow of the system
  * List the commands or methods the user performs to interact with the application
- [ ] Provide a “Lessons Learned” section that contains report sections for the following:
  * Technical expertise gained
  * Insights, time management insights, data domain insights etc.
  * Realized or contemplated alternative design / approaches to the project
  * Document any code not working in this section
- [ ] Provide a “Future work” section containing:
  * Planned uses of the database
  * Potential areas for added functionality
  * No future uses or work can be documented if justification is provided

The final report file should be named canvas_group_name_final_report.pdf, where canvas_group_name
is your group name in canvas. Remember, this is a writing exercise. Please take the 
time to write a cohesive report on your semester’s project.
